# NOTES ON WHAT TO DO 


break up into monthly rain (more granualr vector), maybe try add more months in the beginnings, total, monthly, cumulative (infer things from weights), regress on each, just try to remove variables / preven overfitting them

done this, don't have enough good data to make a good yield function tbh, 0.3 R2 
variables: growing degree days (find base temperature, which is 54 for soybeans), humidity 

1. make sure low troughs are good 
2. rainfall multiple factors, growing degree days into the function

insurance policies, you just buy x amount of insurance 

1. vary over cash and insurance
2. one extreme is cash poor, contrasinted by cash and can't buy as much insurance as eoptimal 
3. other extreme is assume unconstrained 

assume unconstrained

demonstrate that
1. adding second weather factor improves yield (duh)
2. adding second weather factor is feasible for insurance 
3. show that double threshold is better than single threshold
    time to bankruptcy
    utility function calculate the expected utility 
    shortfall from assumed threshold on income, expected shortfall 
    cash after 5 years from some x assumed cash (distribution) 
4. show that annual rainfall is not useful as opposed to monthly 
5.
